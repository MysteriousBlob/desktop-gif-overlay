# Desktop Gif Overlay
This application allows you to display transparent gif videos over your screen.

If it does not operate properly, please make sure that Pillow is installed, if not run the following command:<br>
> `pip install Pillow`

If this doesn't work, then I dunno ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

<hr>

In order to close the app press the `' ] '` key. 
In order to change the gif press the `" ' "` key.
